📘 README.md — Observability Project
🧩 Project Title

End-to-End Observability Stack using Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger, and Loki

🧠 Purpose of the Project
```

The main purpose of this project is to implement a full observability solution for monitoring, tracing, and logging a containerized microservice application.

This setup helps DevOps engineers and developers to:

Monitor real-time application and infrastructure metrics.

Collect, visualize, and analyze logs efficiently.

Trace application requests to identify performance bottlenecks.

Improve reliability, performance, and debugging efficiency in production systems.

```

In short, this project demonstrates how to observe the health, performance, and behavior of a running application using open-source tools in Dockerized form.

🧾 Abstract

This project builds a complete observability ecosystem using:

Prometheus for monitoring & alerting.

Grafana for visualization dashboards.

Jaeger for distributed tracing.

Loki for centralized logging.

A simple Python Flask app that exposes custom metrics via /metrics.

All components are containerized using Docker Compose for easy deployment and management.

🛠️ Tools Used

```
Tool	Purpose
Python Flask	Sample web application that exposes metrics
Prometheus	Scrapes and stores time-series metrics
Grafana	Visualizes metrics & dashboards
Jaeger	Provides distributed tracing for request flows
Loki	Centralized log aggregation and querying
Docker & Docker Compose	To containerize and orchestrate all services

```

```
Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/observability-project.git
cd observability-project


Build and Start Containers

docker compose up -d --build


Access the Services

Flask App → http://localhost:5000

📊 Project Use Case / Real-World Application

This project is a DevOps monitoring and troubleshooting framework that can be used in:

Microservices running in Kubernetes or Docker.

Continuous monitoring of application performance.

Debugging high-latency or failed API requests.

Visualizing trends and resource utilization in real time.

Building alerting and incident response pipelines.

In short, this system provides "observability" — the ability to understand what’s happening inside your system by combining metrics, logs, and traces.

🧩 Conclusion

The Observability Project demonstrates how modern monitoring stacks integrate seamlessly to provide visibility into distributed systems.
By containerizing each tool, it simplifies setup and shows how teams can:

Collect insights.

Detect failures quickly.

Maintain reliability and scalability.

This is an ideal beginner-to-intermediate DevOps project to understand observability concepts hands-on.

🧩 Why It’s Useful

When you containerize Loki (as you did with Docker Compose), it goes through initialization steps:

Loads configuration (loki-config.yml)

Sets up storage backends

Opens ports for ingestion and query API

Marks itself as ready via /ready

So this message:

ready


means Loki’s internal HTTP health check returned success — your logging system is operational 🎉
